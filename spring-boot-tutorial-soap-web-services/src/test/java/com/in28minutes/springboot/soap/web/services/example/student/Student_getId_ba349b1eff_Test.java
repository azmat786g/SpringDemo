Test generated by RoostGPT for test java-web-service using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. **Scenario 1:** Check when the 'id' is null.
   **Test Case:** Invoke the getId() method when the 'id' is not set.
   **Expected Result:** The method should return null, as 'id' is not set.

2. **Scenario 2:** Check when the 'id' is a positive number.
   **Test Case:** Invoke the getId() method when the 'id' has been set to a positive number.
   **Expected Result:** The method should return the positive number, which was set before.

3. **Scenario 3:** Check when the 'id' is zero.
   **Test Case:** Invoke the getId() method when the 'id' has been set to zero.
   **Expected Result:** The method should return zero, as 'id' was set to zero.

4. **Scenario 4:** Check when the 'id' is a negative number.
   **Test Case:** Invoke the getId() method when the 'id' has been set to a negative number.
   **Expected Result:** The method should return the negative number, as 'id' was set to the negative number.

5. **Scenario 5:** Check when the 'id' is the maximum value of Long.
   **Test Case:** Invoke the getId() method when the 'id' has been set to the maximum value of Long.
   **Expected Result:** The method should return the maximum value of Long, as 'id' was set to the maximum value of Long.

6. **Scenario 6:** Check when the 'id' is the minimum value of Long.
   **Test Case:** Invoke the getId() method when the 'id' has been set to the minimum value of Long.
   **Expected Result:** The method should return the minimum value of Long, as 'id' was set to the minimum value of Long.

7. **Scenario 7:** Check the consistency of the returned 'id'.
   **Test Case:** Invoke the getId() method multiple times when the 'id' has been set to a specific value.
   **Expected Result:** The method should always return the same 'id' value, as 'id' should not change during the calls.
